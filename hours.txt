NOTES:

	-TO DO: Download the images so they don't depend on other websites!!

	-When someone rewrites the text to be shorter, I can include that (for instance, Keke's biography on the Faculty is massive)
	-Keke, what do you want the last page to be? Right now it says 'Contact', but the contact info is already provided in the top left corner. The site does not have any section listing the locations of the classes (and no in-class/studio photos either). Replacing the current 'contact' page with a 'Locations' page is a possibility. Otherwise if you have anything else in mind, I can do that.
