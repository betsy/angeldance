NOTES:

	-TO DO: (serverside) use PHP (possibly) --> JSON --> js  ... to load all images from folder instead of manually

	-When someone rewrites the text to be shorter, I can include that (for instance, Keke's biography on the Faculty is massive)
	-Need info for events page
	-Where besides the home page should there be a link to the Register/Locations page?
